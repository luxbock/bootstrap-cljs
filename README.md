# Bootstrap-CLJS
----------------

```clojure
[bootstrap-cljs "0.0.3"]
```

Bootstrap CLJS is a wrapper around [React Bootstrap](http://github.com/react-bootstrap), inspired by, and in fact largely implemented using [om-tools](https://github.com/Prismatic/om-tools). This means that you can use React Bootstrap components using the same syntax as you'd use with `om-tools.dom`, giving you the following benefits, as directly quoted from their README file:

> `om-tools.dom` mirrors the `om.dom` namespace while using macros and minimal runtime overhead to make the following improvements:
> 
> * Element attributes are not required to be JavaScript values and are optional. You don't need to use the `#js` reader macro or `nil` for no attributes.
> * More natural attribute names. We translate attributes like `:class` to `:className` and `:on-click` to `:onClick` to stay consistent with Clojure naming conventions.
> * Children can be in collections. You don't need to use `apply` if you have a sequence of children or use `concat` for combining sequences of siblings.

Example by comparison:

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [om.dom :as dom :include-macros true]))

(apply dom/div #js {}
  (map #(js/ReactBootstrap.Button #js {:bsStyle %} (str/capitalize %))
       ["default" "primary" "success" "info" "warning" "danger"]))
```
vs.

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [om-tools.dom :as dom :include-macros true]
            [bootstrap-cljs :as bs :include-macros true]))

(dom/div
  (map #(bs/button {:bs-style %} (str/capitalize %))
       ["default" "primary" "success" "info" "warning" "danger"]))
```

## Usage

The project comes with examples translated from [React Bootstrap Components](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html) page via a very cool project called [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards). To see the examples in action do `lein deps` -> `lein cljx once` -> `lein figwheel` and navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3449/index.html#!/bootstrap_cljs_devcards` . If everything went as planned you should see a page that looks something like this:

![preview](preview.png)

Open the file `/devcards_src/bootstrap_cljs_devcards.cljs` in your favorite editor and start playing around. Everytime you save the file the changes get compiled and served via [figwheel](http://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), and your browser window should get automatically refreshed so you can see your changes practically in real time.

There is also a [Weasel](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/weasel) browser REPL included with the projects Devcards page. To use it call `(start-repl)` in the `user` namespace and then load up the Devcards page of the project. If you open the JS Console of your browser, you should see a message stating "Opened Websocket REPL connection". You can now start evaluating CLJS expressions in your REPL.

## Alternatives

There's also [om-bootstrap](https://github.com/racehub/om-bootstrap). The key differences are:

- `bootstrap-cljs` (this one right here!) is just a wrapper for React Bootstrap. `om-bootstrap` on the other hand has re-written the React Bootstrap components in ClojureScript, which allows it to take advantage of some performance optimizations that come with using immutable data structures.
- Because `om-bootstrap` does more work to translate the React Bootstrap components to ClojureScript, there are still a few components missing. No doubt they will be added in time though, as the project is actively developed. 
- The syntax between the two is slightly different. Both allow you to pass in regular Clojure maps to specify the props of a component, but `bootstrap-cljs` is more similar to `om-tools` in that you can also omit it the map entirely if it's not needed.
